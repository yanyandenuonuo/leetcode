# House Robber II

## Description

&emsp;&emsp;You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of 
money stashed. All houses at this place are **arranged in a circle**. That means the first house is the neighbor of the 
last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have security system connected and **it will automatically contact the police if 
two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.

&emsp;&emsp;Given a list of non\-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the 
maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police**.

                 because they are adjacent houses.
