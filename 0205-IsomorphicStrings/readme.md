# Isomorphic Strings

## Description

&emsp;&emsp;Given two strings **s** and **t**, determine if they are isomorphic.

&emsp;&emsp;Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in **s** can be replaced to get **t**.

&emsp;&emsp;All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of 
characters. No two characters may map to the same character but a character may map to itself.

## Example

### eg1

```
    Input: s = "egg", t = "add"
    
    Output: true
```

### eg2

```
    Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"
    
    Output: false
```

### eg3

```
    Input: s = "paper", t = "title"
    
    Output: true
```

## Note

&emsp;&emsp;You may assume both **s** and **t** have the same length.
