 *
 * You have a lock in front of you with 4 circular wheels. Each wheel has 10
 * slots: '0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9'. The wheels can
 * rotate freely and wrap around: for example we can turn '9' to be '0', or '0'
 * to be '9'. Each move consists of turning one wheel one slot.
 * 
 * The lock initially starts at '0000', a string representing the state of the
 * 4 wheels.
 * 
 * You are given a list of deadends dead ends, meaning if the lock displays any
 * of these codes, the wheels of the lock will stop turning and you will be
 * unable to open it.
 * 
 * Given a target representing the value of the wheels that will unlock the
 * lock, return the minimum total number of turns required to open the lock, or
 * -1 if it is impossible.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: deadends = ["0201","0101","0102","1212","2002"], target = "0202"
 * Output: 6
 * Explanation:
 * A sequence of valid moves would be "0000" -> "1000" -> "1100" -> "1200" ->
 * "1201" -> "1202" -> "0202".
 * Note that a sequence like "0000" -> "0001" -> "0002" -> "0102" -> "0202"
 * would be invalid,
 * because the wheels of the lock become stuck after the display becomes the
 * dead end "0102".
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: deadends = ["8888"], target = "0009"
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation:
 * We can turn the last wheel in reverse to move from "0000" -> "0009".
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: deadends = ["8887","8889","8878","8898","8788","8988","7888","9888"],
 * target = "8888"
 * Output: -1
 * Explanation:
 * We can't reach the target without getting stuck.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 4:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: deadends = ["0000"], target = "8888"
 * Output: -1
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <=Â deadends.length <= 500
 * deadends[i].length == 4
 * target.length == 4
 * target will not be in the list deadends.
 * target and deadends[i] consist of digits only.
