# Minimum Size Subarray Sum

## Description

&emsp;&emsp;Given an array of **n** positive integers and a positive integer **s**, find the minimal length of a 
**contiguous** subarray of which the sum ≥ **s**. If there isn\'t one, return 0 instead.

## Example

### eg1

```
    Input: s = 7, nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3]
    
    Output: 2
    
    Explanation: the subarray [4,3] has the minimal length under the problem constraint.
```

## Follow up

&emsp;&emsp;If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution of which the time complexity is 
O\(n log n\).
